\chapter{Introduction}

\section*{Background}

Now we move on to development of a standalone Convolution Core which was be designed using industry standard Vivado HLS tools and also AHIR
HLS tools which is a set of in-house tools developed at IIT Bombay by Prof. Madhav Desai. The goal associated with the development of this
core was to speed up the computationally expensive task of convolution of two matrices. It divides the incoming computation among the
internal coprocessors and fires them up in parallel to make the computation faster. 

This core has a FIFO like interface and is capable of pumping out the resultant matrix elements as soon as they have been calculated so that
the write back can begin.

\section*{Need for a HPC peripheral}

These family of cores are useful in various contexts specially Machine Learning and Image Processing algorithms. Development boards which
have a FPGA interfaced with a processor can utilize these kinds of peripherals and allow the programmer to have a simple interface to
offload high computation tasks to codecs on the adjacent FPGA.
