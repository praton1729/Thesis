\chapter{Hardware Usage comparison}

\section{Background}

Here we compare the hardware resources required by the HDL design generated by Vivado HLS and Aa HLS implementation of the same core.
Also within the Aa HLS implementation we compare the hardware resources required by the Pipelined version of the core with the Non-pipelined
version of the core by varying the number of coprocessors utilized in development of the internal architecture of the core.

\subsection{C to VHDL}

\subsubsection*{Non-pipelined Version}

- Need a plot comparing the hardware resources required versus coprocessor number.\\
