\section{Vivado HLS}

Listing~\ref{lst:convolution_engine_vivado_hls} shows the convolution engine design which would convolve a 1024$\times$1024 image with a
3$\times$3 kernel. This is a functionally correct but an unoptimized design for the convolution engine of this size.

\subsection{Aa to VHDL}

Aa is a programming language for the description of algorithms, with the ultimate aim being the conversion of these algorithms into a
hardware implementation. The control-flow in an Aa program corresponds to a petri net of a specific class. The data-flow is constructed
using static single-assignment variables (which can be assigned to only once), storage objects, messaging pipes and constants. Pointers to
storage objects can be created and manipulated (pointer arithmetic, dereferencing etc.) in the usual way. A program in Aa can also be
viewed as a description of a system which reacts with its environment through input and output ports. Thus, an Aa program can either be
executed on a computer, or be mapped to a logic circuit.

\section{Testing Setup}

\subsection{AHIR Testbenches}

\subsubsection{Software Test}
%\paragraph{testbench\_sw \\}
This method of testing the design works only for the C to VHDL design flow. We have a common C testbench file between software and hardware
testing. This testbench when compiled for software testing runs different system units as multiple threads which communicate through
software pipes.

\subsubsection{Hardware Test}
%\paragraph{testbench\_hw and ahir\_system\_test\_bench \\}
This method of testing the design works for the C to VHDL design flow as well as Aa to VHDL design flow. We have a common C testbench file
between software and hardware testing. This testbench when compiled for hardware testing generates to two executables named
\verb|testbench_hw| and \verb|ahir_system_test_bench| which can be run in different shells one after another to start a ghdl simulation
enabled by communicating through sockets.
