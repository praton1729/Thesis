\chapter{Specifications}

Following is the specification for the current storage of image and kernel data:-

\begin{itemize}

\item 8 bits per pixel of image data and also kernel data.
\item Image would be of size 1024 x 1024 pixels (Basically 1022x1022 with zero padding).
\item Kernel would be of size 3 x 3.

\end{itemize}

Following is the specification for the current convolution core:- 

\begin{itemize}

\item An AXI Slave interface as the input interface for the addresses for the fetcher.
\item 32 coprocessors each assigned 32 rows by the fetcher.
\item A FIFO like interface for the fetcher to interface with the convolution core.
\item An AXI Master port for the fetcher for performing write backs to the memory.

\end{itemize}
