and have not misinterpreted or fabricated or falsified any idea/fact/source in my submission. I understand that any violation of the above
will be cause for disciplinary action by the Institute and can also evoke penal action from the sources which have thus not been properly
cited or from whom proper permission has not been taken when needed.
